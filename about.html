           Project Description
        </h2>
        <p class = "description">
          <ul class = "description">
             <li> We wanted to examine data surrouding gender inequality in the workforce because it is an important topic that we knew little about </li>
            <li> We chose these designs because we wanted to keep our information easy to take information away from. We chose to focus in on each state and provide more information about the states with the bar charts and pie chart so that people could understand the gender inequality situation more clearly at not just the country level, but at the state level as well </li>
            <li> Taking the time to look through and visually encode our data showed us important trends around inequality in the workforce and helped us become aware of the prejudices and the economic injustices that women face</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

         Design and Development Process
      </h2>
      <p class = "description">
        <ul class = "description">
          <li> To design and develop the visualizations, first we sketched out what we wished to present. Next, it was important to first develop the map because that is what the other visualizations are dependent on </li>
          <li> We wanted to look at the percent of women in STEM and in other industries as well and we included those in our sketches, but due to time constraints we only were able to focus on these three charts </li>
          <li> We struggled getting the data into the right format we needed for our analysis, but we were able to adjust the dataset and make it work</li>
          <li> We learned that visually encoding data with the ability to filter by a smaller subset of data can be a very effective way to break down a large data set </li>
          <li> We balanced the work among team members by each member being in charge of 1 data visualization. </li>
      </ul>
